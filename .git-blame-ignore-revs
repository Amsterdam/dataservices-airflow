# List commit hashes (full 40 characters) of commits to be ignore when using
# git blame. We generally want to exclude commits that solely formatted parts or
# the entire code base (another reason to use atomic commits). In order for
# this file to be taken into consideration by git run the following command:
#
# git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# To update this file, simply _append_ a commit to it including the first line
# of the commit message.

# Applied black formatting
