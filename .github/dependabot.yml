      # Reason being:
      #   * there is no patch version available yet
      #   * there is no option in Flask-Caching to use other serialization methods
      #     than `pickle`
      #   * Attacker already needs to have acces to the cache storage for this to
      #     be an issue. Hence the serverity is rather limited in our use-case.
